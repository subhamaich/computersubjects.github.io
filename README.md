Clean, handwritten notes on core computer science subjects, published as a simple HTML website.
CS Notes in HTML is my personal collection of handwritten computer science notes, built as a clean, fast, no-framework HTML website.

The goal is simple:
✅ Understand concepts deeply
✅ Explain them in plain language
✅ Keep everything lightweight and accessible

I’m slowly covering core subjects like:
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Operating Systems
- DBMS
- Computer Networks
- OOP & Core Java/Python basics
- Software Engineering & Misc. CS topics

Each topic is written in pure HTML, with:
- Clear headings and summaries
- Short, focused explanations
- Simple diagrams (ASCII / images)
- Code snippets where needed
- Links between related concepts

This repo is mainly for:
- My own revision
- Interview prep
- Anyone who prefers simple, distraction-free notes in the browser

No build tools, no JS frameworks — just HTML, a bit of CSS, and lots of CS content.
